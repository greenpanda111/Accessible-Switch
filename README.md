# Accessible-Switch
Accessible switches allow people with disabilities to interact with toys, games, or other technologies. They come in many different shapes, sizes, styles, and actuation forces. Each person has their unique switch configuration that best allows them to have maximum freedom. However, these switches can cost as low as Â£30 for a single, basic switch. This repository aims to improve access to a basic variety of switch for families and charities.

The switch is assembled from three 3D printed parts, custom PCB, [microswitch](https://uk.farnell.com/omron-electronic-components/d2fs-f-n/microswitch-plunger-spst-0-1a/dp/2402441), 3.5mm mono jack cable, and three springs.

PCBs can be ordered through [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) with default parameters. Simply download the gerbers.zip file and upload it to JLCPCB. The PCBs only require three pins soldering for the microswitch, and the two mono jack wires. This should be accomplishable by someone with minimal soldering experience. The PCBs also have debouncing capacitor support, but these are not neccessary. A 100uA capacitor would be suitable, however.
